Since the beginning of our company, we knew that to make our IoT kit successful, we have to go globally. Why? Not to be a super-rich-startup-C*Os :) But mainly to get the most feedback every day to improve our products. And be able to produce kits in big series to make them cheaper and more affordable for makers. We believe that crowdfunding is the right choice to expand our project to other countries, to find other big clowns and to allow for more significant production batches.

In Indiegogo, we found a team of great people who believe in us from the start of the collaboration and helping us prepare a successful campaign. But it is clear that the success of the campaign depends mainly on those who go into the risk by buying our perks to support our mission. I thank them all in advance, and I promise we will not disappoint their confidence and we will deliver everything purchased on time and in the required quality. Where does this self-confidence come from?

1. ### We have financed our development from our pocket, and we have already done much of it

2. ### We manufactured and delivered several hundreds of our kits to our first clients

3. ### We are a team with massive experience in electronics development and production

We will be enormously happy if you will support our campaign. By purchasing of any perk, or just by spreading the word about us. Thank you very much for your support and favor.

We are all makers. So are you!
