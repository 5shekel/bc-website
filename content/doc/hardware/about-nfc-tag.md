{{< hardware_intro "NFC Tag" nfc-tag >}}

Bridge between NFC and I2C bus.

NFC (or Near Field Communication) is a great technology for transferring data on a short distance (couple of centimeters). This attribute makes this technology appealing for security key provisioning. Many smartphones are today equipped with NFC technology.

NFC Tag builds on NXP’s chip NT3H2111 and operates as a dual-port memory - NFC from one side and I2C from the other side. It features a 1 kB EEPROM memory.

The chip does not have to be powered when being accessed from the NFC side.
