{{< hardware_intro "Mini Battery Module" mini-battery-module >}}
The Mini Battery Module is designed to power BigClown battery-operated devices and has been developed to minimize the size of the entire unit. The dimension does not exceed the size of the standard BigClown modules.

Thanks to the use of a modern, low-power, high-efficiency converter, it provides a long service life of two AAA 1.5 V alkaline cells.

The module contains a battery disconnect circuit when another power supply (such as a DC adapter or USB cable) is connected to the system. The battery voltage can be measured at the analog input of the standardized connector.

A typical example of use is a miniature wireless motion detector or a climate sensor.
