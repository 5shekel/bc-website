The heart of the module is the unique 1.28" Sharp LCD Display with 128 x 128 pixels resolution. The main advantage is ultra low power consumption which guarantees very long battery operation.

You can use two buttons that are located under the LCD to control your applications, such as navigation in the graphical menu. The module is also equipped with a gesture sensor - Avago APDS-9960. This circuit, composed of an infrared transmitter and four directional photodiodes responding to different wavelengths, can also be used to measure light intensity and color or as a proximity sensor.

The LCD Module also includes six high-luminous miniature RGB LEDs that can be used to indicate status or as a light alarm.

A typical example of the use of the LCD Module is a wireless thermostat, or it can directly display values from various sensors located both indoors and outdoors.

The LCD Module can also function as a unique status display for Turris Omnia router.
