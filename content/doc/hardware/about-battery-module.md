{{< hardware_intro "Battery Module" battery-module >}}

Battery Module is designed as a power supply source for battery-operated nodes. Using a low-power buck converter provides excellent efficiency and long battery lifetime from four AAA 1.5 V Alkaline cells.

Load disconnect circuit can bypass batteries if any other power supply source is connected in the system (e.g. AC adapter or USB cable). Battery voltage can be measured on one of the analog inputs of the standardized header.

Battery Module also provides an extra 5-pin socket allowing to connect a BigClown tag (I2C peripheral in a common form factor).

Another useful feature is a prototyping area for soldering your own circuits.
