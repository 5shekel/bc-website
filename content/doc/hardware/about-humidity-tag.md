Relative humidity is another essential property of the environment we live in. The recommended indoor range is between 30 % and 60 %. Values below this range (dry air) can lead to various health issues.

On the other hand values above this range may result in troubles with having moisture.

Humidity Tag uses humidity sensor HDC2080 offering ±2 % accuracy of relative humidity and a very low power consumption making it suitable for battery-powered applications.
