{{< hardware_intro "Base Module" base-module >}}
This module works as a mechanical stand for a BigClown node.

With the exception of Battery Module you can plug any other BigClown module into a standardized socket available on Base Module. This module can be used as a stand on a desk (four rubber feet assure stable position on a surface), mounted on a DIN rail using special plastic clips, or it can be sticked on a wall or other vertical surfaces using a double-sided tape.

The additional feature of this module is a prototyping area for soldering your own circuits.
