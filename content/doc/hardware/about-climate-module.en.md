{{< hardware_intro "Climate Module" climate-module >}}

Climate Module integrates 4 environmental sensors connected to the I²C bus to one single board and allows you to measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and light intensity.

The module serves as a basic building element for the creation of wired and/or wireless weather stations. When powered from the Mini Battery Module, you can create a very compact wireless multi-sensor.
