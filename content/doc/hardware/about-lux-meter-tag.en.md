{{< hardware_intro "Lux Meter Tag" lux-meter-tag >}}
This tag uses ambient light sensor OPT3001 which measures the intensity of visible light.

It measures values in the range from 0.01 to 83k lux with a 23-bit dynamic range. The spectral response of the sensor tightly matches the photopic response of the human eye and includes significant infrared rejection.

This sensor is a digital I2C-only peripheral featuring a very low active and shutdown current.
