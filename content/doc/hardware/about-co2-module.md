{{< hardware_intro "CO2 Module" co2-module >}}

Carbon dioxide (or CO2) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. Its nominal concentration is about 400 ppm (0.04 %). There are many occurrences of CO2 in nature. For example humans produce CO2 using their respiration system during the exhalation phase. High concentration of CO2 leads to acidity and various health related problems.

This is what motivated us to develop CO2 Module. This module achieves ±50 ppm accuracy using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor LP8 designed by SenseAir company from Sweden. Thanks to its low-power operation it can be powered from batteries for years.

BigClown has equipped LP8 sensor with additional circuitry for efficient power management and I2C-only interfacing. Enhancing your environmental monitoring with CO2 Module from BigClown has never been easier.

Last but not least feature of this module are three extra 5-pin sockets allowing to connect BigClown tags (I2C peripheral in a common form factor).
