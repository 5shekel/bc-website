PIR Module is primarily designed to detect the motion of people in the interior. A typical example of using the PIR Module can be a wireless motion detector located on the ceiling of the room

The module is equipped with a digital sensor from Excelitas, type PYQ-1648 from the DigiPyro® family. Thanks to four sensors sensitive to IR radiation and the use of omnidirectional optics, coverage of normally large rooms in the home is guaranteed. An ultra low-power consumption ensures long battery operation.
