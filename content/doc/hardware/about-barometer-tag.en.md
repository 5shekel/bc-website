{{< hardware_intro "Barometer Tag" barometer-tag >}}
Barometer Tag allows measuring **absolute pressure** in the range from 20 kPa to 110 kPa, or **altitude** above the sea level in meters. It uses a low-power sensor **MPL3115A2** with an absolute accuracy of ±0.4 kPa.

Monitoring of absolute pressure is useful for weather forecast and it is also an important parameter in biometeorology because the absolute pressure can affect our health.

This sensor is a digital I2C-only peripheral featuring a very low active and standby current.
