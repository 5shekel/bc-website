{{< hardware_intro "Encoder Module" encoder-module >}}
Encoder Module is the ideal tool for controlling your applications. The module is equipped with a high-quality Bourns rotary encoder with high reliability and durability.

The encoder detects rotation and direction of rotation at 12 positions per revolution. Rotation range is not limited such as the potentiometer and can be rotated in either direction at any number of revolutions. The encoder is also equipped with a push button switch.

The module was designed primarily to complement the LCD module. A typical application that combines both components is a wireless thermostat. The encoder here is used for easy movement in the graphical menu and setting of values.

The encoder module allows you to connect up to three other BigClown Tag readers (5 pin I2C peripherals in the BigClown Tag Format).

The shown aluminum is not a part of the module and is sold as an accessory separately.
