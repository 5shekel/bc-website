Sometimes you need to measure signals during both hardware and software development cycle. And to see what’s going on, you need to quickly hook up an appropriate equipment like an oscilloscope, logic analyzer, etc.

We have made that task simple with Probe Module. This module is an electromechanical interface between test points - the "O"-shaped hooks connected to signals on BigClown header - and your equipment’s probes.
