2. **Development**

   * **Coding** (writing of the source code)

   * **Building** (compilation of the source code)

   * **Programming** (downloading compiled image to the target)

   * **Debugging** (stepping through the program, breakpoints, watching data, etc.)

2. **Testing**

2. **Deployment**
