## Resources

Today every chip vendor that manufacture also RF frontends has their take on sub gigahertz band.

* [Texas Instrumnets](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:Sub-1GHz) - with their Launchpad modular solution
* [Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Sub-1-GHz-RF) - doing a lot in RF, also known for their excelent developer support. They also have Bluetooth 5 mesh routing avilable on their EVK.
* [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/proprietary) - The chip that Telecom Design has based the SigFox modem on [Gecko](https://www.disk91.com/2016/technology/hardware/have-a-good-start-with-telecom-design-efm32-starter-kit/) EVK
* [ST-Microelectronic](http://www.st.com/en/wireless-connectivity/sub-1ghz-rf.html) and Core module radio [SPIRIT1](http://www.st.com/en/wireless-connectivity/spirit1.html) or [SigFox capable SP2](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/wireless-connectivity/sub-1ghz-rf/s2-lp.html)

## Standards

* [ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band)
* [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) - Low rate personal area networks
	* 868.0–868.6 MHz: Europe, allows one communication channel (2003, 2006, 2011[4])
   * 902–928 MHz: North America, up to ten channels (2003), extended to thirty (2006)
   * 2400–2483.5 MHz: worldwide use, up to sixteen channels (2003, 2006)

* [SRD860](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Range_Devices#SRD860) - limits for that band
* ZigBee on IEEE 802.15.4 (Mostly 2.4GHz for worldwide compatibility)
	* garage door control
	* lightning control
	* sensors
* RFID/[NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) (13.78MHz) - contactless cards and access systems, contactless payment (M/C, Visa, Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay), transport cards (Oyster Card TFL ~ NXP Mifare Desfire EV0, Navigo Card Paris ~ Calypso Intercode [hackable](https://en.fabernovel.com/insights/tech-en/hacking-the-navigo))

[Low Power Wide Area Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN) (LPWAN)

* [SigFox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfox) - global network

* [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN#LoRa) - many separate network, roaming should be comming
