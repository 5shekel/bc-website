title: "NodeRED Library Installation"
---
In some projects it is neccesary to use some **NodeRED** libraries wich are not included in default installation of **NodeRED**.

## Library installation

1. Go to your **NodeRED** workflow.

2. Click on hamburger menu on the top right corner and select *Manage pallete*.

3. After click on *Manage pallete* you should see something like this. In *Nodes tab* you can see actually installed libraries to you **NodeRED**. In a *Install* tab you can search for a new libraries. As you can see on the picture I have searched for a blynk library which are commonly used in integrations (**node-red-contrib-blynk-ws**).
