{{% note "danger" %}}This is the **OLD PLAYGROUND** that is installed to your system as a separate services which can have issues on some versions of operating system. We suggest to start with the [**New Playground**]({{< relref "doc/basics/quick-start-guide.en.md" >}}) which is a more advanced single application. However you can still follow this tutorial if you would like to run gateway, mosquitto and node-red as a services on Windows, Linux or macOS.{{% /note %}}
