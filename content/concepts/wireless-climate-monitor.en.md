{{% p-intro title = "About this project" %}}
Measuring temperature, humidity, lumidity and atmospheric pressure is great start to you home automation. It can be first step smart thermostat or automatic blinds. In this project you can find how easy is to build your home Climate Station with Mobile App.{{% /p-intro %}}
