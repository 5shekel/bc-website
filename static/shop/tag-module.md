Some BigClown modules have one or more extra 5-pin sockets allowing to connect a BigClown tag (I²C peripheral in a common form factor). But sometimes this is still not enough or you need to extend the I²C bus with an additional channel.

Tag Module enables to connect up to six extra tags. Every tag has a unique I²C address. Using two independent I²C buses (I2C0 and I2C1) makes it possible to connect two tags of the same address to a single BigClown node.

## Features

* 6x 5-pin socket position for BigClown tag (I²C peripheral)
* 3x tag positions are connected to I2C0 (right side)
* 3x tag positions are connected to I2C1 (left side)
* Operating temperature range: -20 to 70 °C
* Mechanical dimensions: 44 x 55 mm
