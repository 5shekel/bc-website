The **Probe Module** allows you to easily hook up an **oscilloscope** or **logic analyzer** on any signal of the BigClown header. Sometimes during the development you need to analyze the signals and see what's going on. And this module makes the task fast and convenient.

## Features

* Test points for all signals are available on the BigClown header
* Four plated holes (in every corner) for comfortable ground clip connection
* Pin header for hook up of a logic analyzer
* Operating temperature range: -20 to 70 Â°C
* Mechanical dimensions: 88 x 55 mm
