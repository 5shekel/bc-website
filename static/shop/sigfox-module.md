Certified Sigfox Module enables BigClown to communicate with Sigfox wireless network. Signed agreement with your Sigfox network operator is a must.

Sigfox network works in many other countries in Europe (roaming service works automatically). This technology allows you to communicate from a battery-powered device directly to the server, even for several years. By using the narrow band, the device can communicate with the operator cell over a distance of more than 100 km. The modulation speed is only 100 bps, allowing you to use the very narrow bandwidth and thus communicate over long distances even with very low energy demands.

This network has a wide range of applications. Its use is particularly useful in energy consumption meters (e.g. water meters, gas meters, etc.), environmental sensors (e.g. CO2 monitor), but also in applications for early reports of accidents or defects (e.g. water leak detector).

However, it is important to note the important feature of this network, which concerns the limitation of transmitted data. In the Sigfox network, only 140 messages a day with a maximum data payload of 12 bytes (96 bits) can be transferred from the device. This limitation is based on European legislation for the 868 MHz band, which states that the device may not transmit more than 1% of the time of the last 24-hour period. The Sigfox network does not address the format of the data frame - it only guarantees its transfer to a user-defined destination (usually a server service).
