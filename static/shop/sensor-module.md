Sensor Module delivers two universal inputs on a 4-pin plug-in terminal block. The two inputs are connected via the connectors to the Core Module port P4 and P5, two other inputs are connected to ground. Terminals can be used as analog and digital inputs or outputs.

Sensor Module can serve for many useful functions such as interfacing buttons sensing pickup, voltage measurement, RTD temperature sensors measurement, resistance and communication with digital thermometers and other sensors, or digital peripheral control.

## Features

Two universal configurable inputs:

* Interface for 1-wire bus
* Analog input / output
* Logical input / output (log. 1 / log. 0)
* PWM input/timer input and counter
* Controllable pull-up resistor 56 ohms or 4.7 kΩ
* Position for firing the pull-down resistor

Examples of use and connectable peripherals:

* Resistance temperature sensors (Pt 100, Pt 1000, etc.)
* Analogue temperature sensors (LM35, TMP37, etc.)
* NTC temperature sensors
* Digital Dallas sensors on 1-wire bus
* Button connection
* DC voltage measurement
* DC current measurement (on resistive resistance)
* Control of digital 1-wire relay
* Plug-in 4-pin screw terminal block
* Operating voltage range: 1.65 V to 5.5 V
* Operating temperature range: -20 to 70 °C
* Dimensions: 33 x 55 mm
