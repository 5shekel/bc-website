The **Mini Battery Module** is designed as a power supply source for the battery-operated units. The integrated low-power boost converter provides an excellent efficiency from the **two AAA 1.5 V Alkaline** cells. It features a bottom-entry sockets, so the overall profile of the unit you build remains low.

The load disconnect circuit can disconnect the batteries if any other power supply source is connected to the system (e.g. AC adapter or USB cable). The **battery voltage can be measured** on one of the analog inputs of the standardized header (P0/A0/TXD0).
